Now this is a story all about how
My life got twisted upside down
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

In West Philadelphia, born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, max, relaxin' all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of bros who were up to no good
Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought, "Nah, forget it."
â€“ "Yo, home to Bel-Air."
